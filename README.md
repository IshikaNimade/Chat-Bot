This project is a real-time chatbot application built using **React.js** and **Firebase** integration. The chatbot is designed to provide intelligent technical responses, enhancing user interactions and support across multiple devices. The application is fully responsive and supports real-time communication between users and the bot.

## Features
- **Real-Time Communication**: Powered by Firebase, the chatbot responds to user queries in real time.
- **Responsive Design**: Built using Material-UI to ensure a seamless user experience across different devices.
- **Intelligent Responses**: The chatbot is trained to provide relevant technical responses based on user inputs.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean, easy-to-use interface for interacting with the chatbot.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework for building responsive and visually appealing components.
- **Redux Toolkit**: A state management library for handling global state in a predictable way.
- **Firebase**: Provides real-time database capabilities and authentication features for the chatbot.

## Usage

1. **Interacting with the Chatbot**:
   - The user can type a query in the input box, and the chatbot will respond in real time.
   - The bot is trained to provide technical support responses, but it can be customized to answer other queries as needed.

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - The chatbot interface adjusts automatically based on the screen size, providing a consistent experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
